I'm hoping to slowly improve my programming skills (especially algorithmic) and also gain more experience working with Ruby. I'll be doing this by completing Project Euler challenges in Ruby. I'll then upload solutions here. 

The goal is to try and average a challenge a day for the next few weeks (maybe months).
